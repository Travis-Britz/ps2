## Territory Calculations

The basic algorithm works like this:

Start with a list of regions and a list of facility links.

A region may contain a facility, or may not.

### Special Cases

-   Regions without facilities, such as the shattered warpgate, will set the FactionId to 0 even when a continent is locked.
